                    <p>On May 11, 2025, Afghanistan’s interim administration, led by the Taliban, announced an indefinite ban on chess, labeling it a form of gambling under Islamic law. The decision, enforced by the Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, has halted all chess activities, including a planned rapid tournament in a major city. The Afghanistan National Chess Federation, now operating in exile, faces challenges as the sport’s community grapples with the sudden restriction. Local players and cafe owners who hosted informal tournaments expressed disappointment, noting the cultural loss for a game with a decades-long history in the country.</p>
